Problem statement
You've developed a chat room application, and now it's time to enhance it by adding a message storage feature. Imagine running a real-time chat application where users exchange messages. You need to create a message schema and store all these messages in a database for future retrieval and analysis.

Objective:

Implement the storage mechanism to efficiently store and retrieve messages when users send messages using the "sendMessage" functionality.

Schema Fields:

username: The sender's username

text: The content of the message

room: The identifier for the chat room

timestamp: The timestamp of the message
