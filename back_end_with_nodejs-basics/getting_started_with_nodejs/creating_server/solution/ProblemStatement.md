Problem statement
Let's create a basic Node.js HTTP server on port 8080, a foundational step in web service development for handling interactions between clients and servers.

Objectives:

i) Create a server using the HTTP module and store the server instance in a variable named "server" within "index.js" file.
ii) Configure the server to listen on port 8080.

iii) The server should respond with the message, "Response received at port 8080."
