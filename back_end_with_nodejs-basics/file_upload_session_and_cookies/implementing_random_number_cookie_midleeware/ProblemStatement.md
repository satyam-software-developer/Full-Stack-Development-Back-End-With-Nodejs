Problem statement
In a game developed by a programmer, the server generates a random number, stores it in a cookie, and allows users to guess the number. User authentication is a prerequisite, limiting participation to logged-in individuals. The required implementations, including user login, signup, and authentication, are already in place. Assistance is now needed to implement the necessary express-session.

Objectives

i) Implement the necessary Express Session to manage and maintain user sessions in the application.
ii) Review and understand each endpoint and its respective controller for a comprehensive understanding of the existing implementations.
iii) Complete the implementation of the middleware function "generateRandomNumber" inside the file "middleware/generateRandomNumber.js" to generate a random number between 1 and 10. Set this number as a cookie named 'randomNumber'.

Note:
This random number is set as a cookie whenever a user logs in to our website.

Expected Output:

After successfully implementing the provided problem, ensure that your output aligns with the demonstration given in the reference video.
