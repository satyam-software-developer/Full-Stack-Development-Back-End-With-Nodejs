Problem statement
In the given e-commerce Node.js project, Implement an error-handling middleware using the Error class inside 'src/middlewares/errorHandler.js'.

This middleware is employed at the application level to manage errors arising from various operations. It should be designed to capture intentionally thrown errors with custom status codes and error messages.

Unhandled errors should trigger a "500" status code along with the error message "Oops! Something went wrong... Please try again later!".

Objectives:

i) Implement the 'src/middlewares/errorHandler.js' middleware to effectively capture errors.
ii) Capture intentionally thrown errors with customized status codes and messages.
iii) Implement the logic to handle unhandled errors with a default "500" status code and a user-friendly error message.

Expected Output:

After successfully implementing the provided problem, ensure that your output aligns with the demonstration given in the reference video.
