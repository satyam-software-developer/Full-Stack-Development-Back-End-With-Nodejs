i) Implement a route handler for the root route('/') inside "index.js" file.
Handle GET requests by responding with the message 'get'.
Handle POST requests by responding with the message 'post'.
Handle PUT requests by responding with the message 'put'.
Handle DELETE requests by responding with the message 'delete'.
