Problem statement
In this coding problem, you are tasked with resolving an issue in the backend of an employee management application. Your friend, who is working on the frontend part, needs to fetch a list of employees from the API "http://localhost:4000/api/v1/emp" and display it on the HTML page.
However, there seems to be an issue in the backend code that prevents the frontend from displaying the employee list correctly.

Objective:
Fix the backend code to resolve the issue with the employee list API.

Note:
CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a security feature implemented in web browsers to restrict web pages from making requests to a domain different from the one that served the original web page, known as the same-origin policy. When building web applications with frontend and backend servers, CORS issues may arise if they're hosted on different domains, subdomains, or ports. In Node.js, when building APIs or serving resources accessed by web pages from different origins, enabling CORS becomes necessary.

Expected Output:
Upon successful completion, the frontend HTML page should display a list of employees fetched from the backend API "http://localhost:4000/api/v1/emp".

Requirements:
Frontend: JavaScript with Fetch API.

Notes/Hints:
Examine the backend code carefully to identify and fix the issue with the employee list API.
To start the front-end HTML page, you can utilize the VS Code Live Server extension, as demonstrated in the GIF. If it's not already installed, simply download it from the Extensions tab in VS Code by searching for "Live Server" and installing the corresponding extension.
