Problem statement
Learn to implement methods in a Node.js project following MVC architecture, specifically focusing on fetching data from a file and rendering it using a template. Gain practical experience in creating a product listing page with the retrieved data.

Objectives

i) Implement the fetchProducts method in the ProductModel class to fetch an array of products from the src/assets/products.js file. No need to modify the pre-written code in 'src/assets/products.js'.
ii) Complete the getProducts method in the ProductController class to render the product.ejs template with the fetched product details displayed in a table.

iii) Complete the "product.ejs" view to display the details of the products in a table.

Note:
Design the table layout using HTML and CSS, either with a CSS framework or your own custom styles.
Ensure the product.ejs template is correctly rendered with the product data in the table.
