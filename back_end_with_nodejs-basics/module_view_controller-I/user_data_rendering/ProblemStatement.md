Problem statement
Enhance your Node.js MVC skills by developing an admin dashboard for an e-commerce platform. Gain skills in efficiently fetching and displaying essential user details, enhancing decision-making and overall management efficiency for an e-commerce platform.

Objectives

i) You have been provided an API 'https://dummyjson.com/users' that contains a users array. The array comprises objects, each detailing user information (e.g., [User Details]).

ii) Implement the 'userModel' function inside users.model.js to fetch users' details from the provided API using axios.

Ensure that the function returns only the array of users obtained from the API response, excluding the entire response object.

iii) Implement the 'userController' to render the details of users fetched using userModel using the 'index.ejs' view.

Render the data in a table format, utilizing your own styling.
Display only user's name, email, mobile number, gender, city, pincode, and profile image.
The route provided for rendering the details is app.get("/users", userController).

Notes:
Follow the folder structure and file locations mentioned in the problem statement.
Refer to the starter code in 'index.ejs' to implement the table rendering.
