Problem statement
This task underscores the significance of incorporating robust validation practices, particularly for user data in web applications.

Objectives:

i) Introduce a middleware named "formValidationMiddleware" to enhance the existing Node.js application. This middleware should specifically handle the validation of form data for the "newUser" functionality within the "user.controller.js".
ii). Refactor the code by moving the validation logic to the middleware while maintaining the existing functionality.

iii). Modify the "user.controller.js" file to use the "formValidationMiddleware" for the '/new' route.

Note:
The middleware function should be named "formValidationMiddleware" and placed within the "middleware.js" file located in the root directory.
