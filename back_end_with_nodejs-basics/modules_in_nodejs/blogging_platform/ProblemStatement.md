Problem statement
In the digital age, blogging has become an essential medium for expressing thoughts, sharing knowledge, and connecting with a global audience.

Objectives

Given the file "blogActions.js" which contains two functions, 'writeBlog' and 'publishBlog':
Implement the writeBlog function to accept a file path and the user's blog (string content) as parameters.This function should save the blog to the specified file using the synchronous append method of the fs module.
Implement the publishBlog function to accept a file path as a parameter. This function should read and return the content of the file present at the specified path using the synchronous read method of the fs module.

Notes:
Implement the module using ES6 syntax, without requiring a change in the file extension(.mjs).
The use of the keyword interface is not permitted, as it may function correctly on a local machine but will result in test failures on the backend.
