Problem statement
In a Node.js project, you need to fetch data from an API using the axios package. This package allows asynchronous HTTP requests in Node.js and simplifies the process of making API calls.

In this scenario, you'll use axios to fetch data from the https://api.codingninjas.com/api/v3/event_tags API endpoint.

Objectives

i) Install the axios package using npm.
ii) Make an HTTP GET request to the given API endpoint using axios to print the data as displayed in the expected output.
iii) Retrieve the response data.
iv) Print the response to the console as shown in the expected output section.

Note:
Ensure that you have the axios package installed in your Node.js project before proceeding.
Make use of asynchronous programming techniques while fetching data using axios.
