Problem statement
Practice writing a code snippet for handling POST requests, appending the request body to a file (file name unspecified) and printing its contents to the console. Gain hands-on experience applicable in scenarios requiring data storage, retrieval, and processing, such as logging or data persistence.

Objectives:

i) Complete the implementation of index.js to handle a POST request.
ii) Read the request body and append it to the "data.txt" file.
iii) Read and print the new content of the text file to the console.
iv) Handle responses using res.end for complete data reception and non-POST request methods.

Notes:
Please make sure to utilize the synchronous functions provided by the file system module in Node.js.
To successfully make the POST request, pass the following data:
{
"message": "Be yourself; everyone else is already taken."
}

as shown below:
